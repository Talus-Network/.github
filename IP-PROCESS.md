# Improvement Proposal (IP) Process for FDD-Release Framework

## Overview

This process serves as the **Architecture Pipeline** in our FDD-Release framework, providing the formal mechanism for evaluating and approving changes before they enter the Feature Pipeline. It supports **dual-stream input**: internal strategic planning (Notion) and external community contributions (GitHub Discussions), both converging at formal IP creation on GitHub.

## Dual-Stream Architecture

### **Internal Stream (Private)**

**Strategic initiatives** ‚Üí **Notion RFC** ‚Üí **GitHub IP**

### **External Stream (Public)**

**Community ideas** ‚Üí **GitHub Discussion** ‚Üí **GitHub RFC** ‚Üí **GitHub IP**

### **Convergence Point**

**All streams** ‚Üí **GitHub IP Issue** ‚Üí **Epic Creation**

## Process Phases

## Comment Resolution Process

### **Purpose**

Comments drive the proposal evaluation process and ensure thorough review. **Open comments must be resolved before a proposal can be finalized.** This maintains quality and prevents important concerns from being overlooked.

### **Comment Types & Handling**

### **Strategic Comments (Notion-based)**

- **Business Case Questions**: Clarifications on value proposition or strategic fit
- **Resource Concerns**: Questions about timeline, budget, or team allocation
- **Priority Challenges**: Discussions about relative importance vs other initiatives

### **Technical Comments (GitHub-based)**

- **Implementation Questions**: Technical approach or feasibility concerns
- **Security Issues**: Risk identification and mitigation strategies
- **Integration Concerns**: Impact on existing systems or architecture
- **Performance Questions**: Scalability, efficiency, or resource utilization

### **Resolution Responsibilities**

### **Comment Author Responsibilities**

- **Open comments constructively**: Provide specific, actionable feedback
- **Close own comments**: Author is responsible for determining when their concern is addressed
- **Engage in discussion**: Participate actively in resolution efforts
- **Escalate when needed**: Flag complex issues requiring review sessions

### **Proposal Author Responsibilities**

- **Address comments promptly**: Respond within 48 hours during active review
- **Provide detailed responses**: Don't dismiss concerns‚Äîaddress them substantively
- **Update proposal content**: Incorporate feedback into proposal when appropriate
- **Request clarification**: Ask for specifics if comments are unclear

### **Review Team Responsibilities**

- **Monitor comment resolution**: Ensure progress is being made
- **Facilitate discussions**: Help resolve deadlocks or misunderstandings
- **Enforce standards**: Don't allow premature comment closure
- **Schedule review sessions**: Organize meetings for complex issues

### **Comment Resolution Workflow**

### **1. Comment Creation**

```
Comment Author:
1. Creates specific, actionable comment
2. Tags relevant reviewers if needed
3. Clearly states concern or question
```

### **2. Response & Discussion**

```
Proposal Author:
1. Acknowledges comment within 48 hours
2. Provides detailed response or requests clarification
3. Updates proposal if needed
4. Requests comment closure when addressed

Community:
1. Provides additional context or perspectives
2. Helps clarify technical or strategic points
3. Suggests alternative approaches
```

### **3. Comment Resolution**

```
Comment Author (ONLY):
1. Reviews response and updated proposal
2. Confirms concern is adequately addressed
3. Closes comment with resolution note
4. OR explains why concern remains unresolved
```

### **Complex Comment Escalation**

### **Triggers for Review Sessions**

- Comment thread exceeds 10 exchanges without resolution
- Technical disagreement between experts
- Strategic conflict requiring leadership decision
- Cross-functional coordination needed
- Timeline impact of unresolved comments

### **Review Session Process**

1. **Schedule**: Proposal author or reviewer requests session
2. **Participants**: Comment authors, proposal author, relevant experts
3. **Agenda**: Focus specifically on unresolved comments
4. **Outcome**: Clear resolution path or escalation decision
5. **Documentation**: Session notes added to proposal

### **Escalation Levels**

```
Level 1: Peer Review Session
- Technical leads + proposal author
- Focus on technical resolution

Level 2: Cross-Functional Review
- Multiple department leads
- Strategic and technical alignment

Level 3: Leadership Decision
- Leadership team final arbitration
- Used sparingly for deadlocked issues

```

### **Quality Standards**

### **Do NOT Close Comments When:**

- ‚ùå Response doesn't actually address the concern
- ‚ùå "We'll figure it out later" without concrete plan
- ‚ùå Proposal author asks you to close without resolution
- ‚ùå Concern is dismissed rather than addressed
- ‚ùå Technical debt is acknowledged but not mitigated

### **DO Close Comments When:**

- ‚úÖ Concern is substantively addressed in proposal updates
- ‚úÖ Alternative approach adequately mitigates the risk
- ‚úÖ Additional context shows concern is not applicable
- ‚úÖ Explicit mitigation strategy is documented
- ‚úÖ Follow-up work is clearly defined and tracked

### **Process Gates**

### **Cannot Add `final` Tag Until:**

- All strategic comments in Notion are resolved
- All technical comments in GitHub are resolved
- Review sessions for complex issues are completed
- Proposal updates incorporate substantive feedback

### **Cannot Approve Proposal Until:**

- `final` tag has been applied
- Comment resolution is verified by review team
- No open threads remain in either Notion or GitHub

### **Tracking & Transparency**

### **Comment Status Tracking**

```
GitHub Issue Comments:
- Use üëç reaction when concern is addressed
- Comment author confirms with "Resolved: [brief reason]"
- Proposal author summarizes resolution in proposal update

Notion Comments:
- Use comment resolution features
- Document resolution rationale
- Reference in strategic approval decision

```

### **Resolution Summary**

Before final approval, proposal author provides:

- **Comments Addressed**: Count and brief summary
- **Key Changes Made**: How proposal evolved based on feedback
- **Outstanding Risks**: Any concerns accepted but not mitigated

This ensures robust evaluation while maintaining forward momentum and preventing process paralysis.

### **IP ‚Üí Epic Transition**

When IP is **accepted**:

1. **Epic Creation**: Use Epic Template with IP reference
2. **Pre-Implementation Checklist**: IP approval covers:
    - ‚úÖ Product Design Review (Strategic RFC)
    - ‚úÖ Architectural Review (Technical RFC)
    - ‚úÖ Finalized Specifications (IP Issue)
3. **Feature Pipeline**: Epic enters implementation phase

### **Traceability Chain**

```
Strategic Need (Notion)
    ‚Üì
Strategic RFC (Notion)
    ‚Üì
Technical RFC (GitHub Discussions)
    ‚Üì
IP Issue (GitHub Issues)
    ‚Üì
Epic (GitHub Projects)
    ‚Üì
Implementation Issues (GitHub Issues)
    ‚Üì
Release (GitHub Releases)
```

## Notion ‚Üî GitHub Integration

### **Current State (Internal Focus)**

- **Strategic planning**: Notion-based
- **Technical evaluation**: GitHub-based
- **Cross-references**: Links between systems
- **Decision authority**: Leadership Team using both contexts

### **Future State (Public Contributions)**

- **External RFCs**: GitHub Discussions only
- **Internal strategic evaluation**: Notion assessment of external proposals
- **Unified technical process**: All technical evaluation on GitHub
- **Single source of truth**: GitHub becomes primary with Notion as strategic overlay

## Advantages of This Approach

### **1. Respects Current Workflow**

- Strategic teams continue using Notion
- Technical teams continue using GitHub
- Clear handoff points between phases

### **2. Prepares for Public Contributions**

- GitHub-based technical process ready for external contributors
- Strategic evaluation layer protects internal priorities
- Clean separation between public technical discussion and internal business decisions

### **3. Maintains Single Source of Truth**

- Each phase has clear ownership and location
- Cross-references maintain traceability
- Decision rationale captured in both systems

### **4. Integrates with FDD-Release**

- IP process = Architecture Pipeline
- Clear transition to Feature Pipeline via Epic creation
- Release checklist references IP completion

## Migration Strategy

### **Phase 1: Internal Implementation**

- Implement full IP process for internal proposals
- Establish Notion ‚Üî GitHub workflow
- Train teams on process and templates

### **Phase 2: Selective Public Opening**

- Open specific technical areas for external RFC
- Maintain strategic evaluation internally
- Test public contribution workflow

### **Phase 3: Full Public Process**

- Open full technical contribution process
- GitHub becomes primary system
- Notion becomes strategic oversight layer

## Private Development Support

### **Non-Public Development Requirements**

For development that cannot be public during implementation:

1. **Repository Forking**: Create private fork of relevant repository
2. **Private IP Process**: Follow same IP process in private fork
3. **Documentation Tracking**: Maintain ADRs and documentation in private fork
4. **Release Coordination**:
    - Push development branch to public repository when ready
    - Transfer IP documentation as part of release epic
    - Update public documentation to reflect new features
    - Maintain traceability from private IP to public release

### **Private-to-Public Transition**

- **Documentation Task**: Include IP transfer in release epic checklist
- **Community Communication**: Announce new features with reference to transferred IP
- **Historical Continuity**: Maintain decision rationale even when moving from private to public

This approach ensures consistent process regardless of development visibility while protecting sensitive development when necessary.
