        ## Feature Request Process

        **Important**: Most feature requests should start as [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) to gather community input before creating formal requests.

        Use this template for:
        - Internal business-driven feature requirements
        - Requests that have been discussed and refined in community discussions
        - Cross-functional feature requests requiring coordination

        **Response Time**: Feature requests are reviewed in weekly planning cycles.
