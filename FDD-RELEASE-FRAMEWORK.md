# Feature Driven Development & Release Framework

This document describes Talus's development and release process, integrating Feature Driven Development (FDD) with our systematic release framework. It defines the interface between Product and Engineering teams and establishes clear workflows for bringing ideas from conception to production.

## Core Framework

### Pipeline Architecture

The FDD-Release framework operates through four sequential pipelines, each with clear ownership and deliverables:

| Pipeline                  | Release Phase                  | Interface Point                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Architecture Pipeline     | Product Design Review          | Strategic → Tactical Translation |
| Feature Pipeline (Spec)   | Technical Feasibility Analysis | Requirements → Implementation    |
| Feature Pipeline (Build)  | Technical Implementation       | Engineering Execution            |
| Feature Pipeline (Deploy) | Release                        | Engineering → Product Handover   |

### Decision Gates

Each pipeline includes structured decision points with clear criteria:

- **Architecture Pipeline**: Strategic evaluation and IP approval process
- **Feature Spec**: Technical feasibility and implementation planning
- **Feature Build**: Quality assurance and pre-release validation
- **Feature Deploy**: Release execution and stakeholder handover

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Architecture Pipeline - Strategic Alignment

**Dual-Stream Input** converging on formal **Improvement Proposals (IPs)**

#### Internal Stream (Strategic Initiatives)
- Strategic RFC creation in internal planning systems
- Leadership team evaluation for strategic fit and resource allocation
- Business case validation and priority assessment

#### External Stream (Community Contributions) 
- Community discussions in GitHub Discussions
- Technical RFC development for implementation approaches
- Community consensus building and technical validation

#### Convergence Point
Both streams converge at formal **IP creation on GitHub**, following our [Improvement Proposal Process](IP-PROCESS.md). All significant changes require IP approval before entering implementation.

**Deliverable**: Approved IP with strategic validation and technical feasibility confirmation

### Phase 2: Feature Pipeline (Specification) - Technical Translation

**Cross-functional collaboration** between Product and Engineering teams

- **Feature Design**: Detailed functional requirements and user acceptance criteria
- **Technical Feasibility**: Implementation approach and dependency analysis  
- **Impact Assessment**: Downstream effects and integration requirements
- **Spec Review**: Cross-functional approval and task breakdown

**Deliverable**: Detailed feature specifications with approved implementation tasks

### Phase 3: Feature Pipeline (Build) - Engineering Execution

**Engineering-led implementation** with defined quality gates

- **Implementation**: Code development following GitHub task breakdown
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Documentation**: Technical documentation and user-facing guides
- **Pre-Release Preparation**: Infrastructure setup and deployment readiness

**Deliverable**: Tested, documented features ready for production deployment

### Phase 4: Feature Pipeline (Deploy) - Release & Handover

**Cross-functional release execution** with clear handover processes

- **Release Preparation**: Final validation and deployment coordination
- **Production Deployment**: Coordinated release with monitoring and rollback procedures
- **Stakeholder Handover**: 
  - **DevRel**: Developer documentation and integration materials
  - **Product**: Feature validation and success metrics
  - **Marketing**: Communication materials and announcements

**Deliverable**: Successfully deployed features with complete stakeholder handover

## IP Integration

The Architecture Pipeline is implemented through our formal [Improvement Proposal Process](IP-PROCESS.md):

- **IP Creation**: All features begin with approved IPs, regardless of origin (internal/external)
- **Technical Review**: Comprehensive evaluation of feasibility, impact, and implementation approach
- **Comment Resolution**: Systematic resolution of all technical and strategic feedback
- **Epic Generation**: Approved IPs automatically generate implementation epics

## Tool Integration

### Primary Development Tools

- **GitHub**: Issue tracking, project management, and technical coordination
- **Internal Planning Systems**: Strategic planning and business case development
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

### Process Interfaces

- **IP Approval** → **Epic Creation**: Seamless transition from strategic approval to implementation planning
- **Specification Completion** → **Task Generation**: Automatic breakdown into actionable development tasks
- **Implementation Completion** → **Release Preparation**: Systematic handover to deployment processes

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Established coding standards for all supported languages
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements
- Automated code quality validation
- Security review for sensitive components

### Process Quality
- All changes tracked through formal IP process
- Clear traceability from strategic need to deployed feature
- Systematic documentation requirements
- Stakeholder sign-off at each phase boundary

### Release Quality
- Comprehensive pre-deployment testing
- Coordinated release communication
- Post-deployment monitoring and validation
- Clear rollback procedures for issues

## Emergency Procedures

For critical fixes requiring immediate deployment:

1. **Emergency Epic Creation**: Using streamlined emergency epic template
2. **Accelerated Review**: Essential quality gates with compressed timelines
3. **Expedited Deployment**: Minimal viable process with full documentation
4. **Post-Emergency Analysis**: Retrospective and process improvements

Emergency releases integrate with our [Incident Management Plan](INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT-PLAN.md) for coordinated crisis response.

## Process Benefits

### For Development Teams
- **Clear Ownership**: Unambiguous responsibility at each phase
- **Predictable Workflow**: Consistent process regardless of feature complexity
- **Quality Focus**: Built-in quality gates prevent technical debt accumulation

### for Product Teams  
- **Strategic Alignment**: Direct connection between business needs and technical implementation
- **Transparent Progress**: Real-time visibility into development status
- **Coordinated Releases**: Systematic handover ensures proper launch execution

### For the Organization
- **Scalable Process**: Framework adapts from small features to major releases
- **Community Integration**: External contributions follow same quality standards
- **Risk Management**: Systematic evaluation prevents costly mistakes

## Continuous Improvement

This framework evolves through:

- Regular retrospectives and process refinement
- Community feedback integration
- Tool optimization and automation
- Best practice documentation and sharing
